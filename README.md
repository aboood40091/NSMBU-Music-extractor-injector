# NSMBU-Music-extractor-injector v0.1
NSMBU Music extractor and injector.
Copyright © 2017 Stella/AboodXD

## Extracting Usage:
* main bfsar
bfsar: NSMBU BFSAR file

## Injecting Usage:
* main bfsar num bfwav
bfsar: NSMBU BFSAR file
num: Track number
bfwav: BFWAV file

## Limits:
* The BFSAR has to be the original NSMBU BFSAR (or a one you have injected to), and not a new rebuilt BFSAR.
The reason for this is that the offsets to the music files is hardcoded.

* The BFWAV has to be smaller or equal in file size to the original BFWAV that you want to replace/inject to.

## Track numbers:
Used for injecting, I have sorted all the track numbers here:
